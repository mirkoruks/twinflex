# twinflex
twinflex is a wrapper function for OpenMx. It allows you to estimate complex twin models with just one line of code. Furthermore you can combine different types of twin models (univariate, GxE, with or without covariates, Cholesky vs. ACE-beta) individually. It is still a beta version. So if you find any bugs or have any questions or suggestions, please send me a message (mirko.ruks@uni-bielefeld.de) or start an issue here on Github.
